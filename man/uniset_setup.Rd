\usage{
uniset_setup(where = NULL, unisetEnv)
}
\arguments{
\item{where}{Character length one, holding the path to the location where the 
folder containing the settings.R file should be located. Defaults to 'NULL'. 
If left at the default 'NULL', the location should be selectable interactively.}

\item{unisetEnv}{Character length one. Hand over the global variable defined
in the target package holding the name of the uniset-environment for the
specific target package ('uniset_env_name' or 'uev', see examples at
\code{\link{uniset}}.)}
}
\value{
Called for its side effects, i.e. to initiate the dynamic settings file 
system (see Details.) Returns an (invisible) character length one holding the 
path to the settings-home directory.
}
\description{
Perform the required setup to enable the target package to make 
use of the functionality of package 'uniset'. Only has to be called once 
by the user of the target package.
}
\details{
This function is intended to be called from \strong{within} the 
target package by the user of the target package. Only has to be called once 
to initiate the system, i.e. to
\itemize{
\item Define the folder where the settings.R file will be located,
\item Copy the settings.R file into this folder, and
\item Create a corresponding entry in the .Renviron file (or create the 
.Renviron file if does not exit).
}
As CRAN policies forbid to write into user homespace by default, this setup 
has to be done manually (but only once!) by the user of the target package. 
However, if called repeatedly, it enables the user of the target package to 
conveniently change the settings-home directory and its corresponding variable 
in the .Renviron file. In that case, a factory-fresh version of the settings.R 
file will be copied into the new settings-home directory. For the user-defined 
values in the 'old' settings.R file not to be lost, the user then has to 
manually move / copy the settings from the old location to the new one.
}
\section{Important}{
 This function is meant to be called from within the 
target package.
