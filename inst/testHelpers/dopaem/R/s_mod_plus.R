# any of these key=value pairs can be accessed in the code of your package 'dogPack' by using simply
# .doe$stn$favouriteColor, for example. Instead of 'favouriteColor' any other of the keys defined
# in the list above can be used. 
# You can create as many key=value pairs as you want. 

# Key=value pairs have to specified exactly in the format as shown above, with a ',' (comma) after the value!
# (as this is nothing but a simple list, and in a list the key=value pairs have to be separated by a comma.)
# The keys have to be unique (obviously). 

# Do not change the name of the object holding the list - in this case, 'stn'
