# have to be separated by a comma.)
# The keys have to be unique (obviously).

# this case, 'XXX_obj'

# empty lines and comments can be introduced or deleted at the users wish
# it is recommended to place comments, explanations etc. to a specific key
# directly into the line holding the key.
# comments have to be preceeded by a '#'
