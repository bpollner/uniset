Second submission to CRAN

## New
* User-space is not written into any more by default. Now there is a dedicated setup-function to be called by the user. Only this setup-function does write into user space according to the path provided by the user. System-setup and system-check is now completely separated.
* .GlobalEnv is not written into any more. Instead, a separate object is created on the search path where all required environments reside. 
* Have an additional file 'uniset_functions.R' generated in the process of preparing the target package, containing custom-tailored functions to be used in functions defined in the target package. 


## IMPROVED:
* Manuals (all return values now explained in detail); readme.md; description.
* Examples: Only those examples that really can not be run stay wrapped in  \dontrun{}.
* Various other details.
