NEW:
	User-space is not written into any more by default. Now there is a dedicated setup-function to be called by the user. Only this setup-function does write into user space according to the path provided by the user.
	.GlobalEnv is not written into any more. Instead, a separate object is created on the search path where all required environments reside. 


IMPROVED:
	Manuals (all return values now explained in detail); readme.md; description.
	Examples: Only those examples that really can not be run stay wrapped in  \dontrun{}.
