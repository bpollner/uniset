# any of these key=value pairs can be accessed in the code of your package 'dogPack' by using simply
# .doe$stn$favouriteColor, for example. Instead of 'favouriteColor' any other of the keys defined
# in the list above can be used. 
# You can create as many key=value pairs as you want. 

# Key=value pairs have to specified exactly in the format as shown above, with a ',' (comma) after the value!
# (as this is nothing but a simple list, and in a list the key=value pairs have to be separated by a comma.)
# The keys have to be unique (obviously). 

# Do not change the name of the object holding the list - in this case, 'stn'

# If you add a new variable within a block *below the first* variable of the block, 
# this variable gets simply inserted into the settings file of the user. (Only the first variable
# of a block acts as a hook.)
# There can be any number of empty lines between blocks. 


# If you add a new block, or you add a variable *above the first* variable of the block,
# the userÂ´s settings-file can not be updated any more, and the user has to manually insert
# the changes into the settings-file.
# Therefore it is recommended to pre-generate some blocks - depending on the complexity of your package,
#' so that the user of your package will not have to manually insert the new variables into the settings file.
