# uniset

Package `uniset` provides an easily accessible, user-friendly text file as settings-file for your R-package.

## Summary

-   Package `uniset` enables any package (the 'target package') to provide its users an easily accessible, user-friendly and human readable text file where key=value pairs (used by functions defined in the target package) can be saved.
-   This settings file lives in a location defined by the user of the target package, and its **user-defined values remain unchanged** even when the author of the target package is introducing or deleting keys, or when the target package is updated or re-installed.
-   In order to enable the target package to make use of the functionality offered by package `uniset`, four files have to be exported by `uniset` and be placed into the target package.

## Installation

Install release version from CRAN via

``` r
install.packages("uniset") 
```

Or download from github:

``` r
library(devtools)
install_github(repo="bpollner/uniset", ref="master")
```
